#  *  Notes on language style  *
#  
#	1. 	When not explicitely using "he, him, her, etc." or situations in which the context implies only men or women, most "group" terms are used to inflect either gender.
#		This follows what I interpret as a continuation of the modern trend toward encompassing both genders into previously "male" or "female" terms. 
#		For example, "Lads" equates to a group of men, women, or men and women in the same way as "guys" or "dudes". It does not strictly imply males unless contextually specified. 
#		My intent is to provide thematic variability and allow conversations to flow naturally where NPCs would normally use the player character's gender (which the game does not know) without always using implied addresses or the handful of neutral addresses we currently have.

	`	Captains, crew, and a good number of slaves look at you with a mixture of confusion and outright hostility. But alongside the usual ruffians and scallywags, you spot a very sizeable older-looking gentleman - or, as near to a gentleman as you'd expect to find in these parts - strutting about merrily, inspecting ships and sharing the occasional laugh with the denizens of the spaceport. A sharpness in his eyes belies his large, jolly appearance. He spots you and approaches.`

A merchant patrol is spotted in Danoa or Rajak, but by the time we get there, it's vanished. A whole damn fleet of Behemoths head to Hassaleh and never make it to Cardax!"`
	`	Otto paces around for a few seconds before he regains his composure. A pleasant smile spreads across his face once more.`
	`	"So, we're looking fer someone to investigate these irksome little disappearances. It's got the lads a little spooked - talk of space ghosts, biblical leviathans in the stars... Ye name it, the rumor's been started."`

		`	"I've always wanted to meet a space ghost!"`
		`	"Why me?"`
	
	`	Otto takes off his patched beanie and scratches his head. "I ain't gonna coat it with sugar, laddie. The last few scoutin' parties we sent out never made it back. So we're lookin' fer someone a little more expendable."`
	`	You bite your lips, not quite relishing the answer you've been given.`
	`	Before you can react, Otto laughs and claps you on the shoulder, nearly knocking you over. "Lighten up, kid! Truth is, we pirates have a certain look, and ye fit the bill of a plucky young'n just out for a space-walk. If there is anything out there waitin' for us, maybe ye'll be able to sweet-talk 'em."`

Ye might want to bring a Ramscoop or spare fuel pods if ye don't have 'em. And if ye find somethin', ye let ol' Otto know; there'll be somethin' extra in it fer ye. Eh, kiddo?"`

		`	"Got it."`
		`	"I'll be back before you know it, gramps."`

	`	You stare after Otto as he walks away, wondering exactly what you've gotten yourself into.`

	`	You feel proud to have scared off such an intimidating figure as Otto. But when you return to your ship a couple hours later, you notice several shady characters scatter as you approach. An acrid odor assaults your senses; as you walk past the forward landing gear, a dead fish flops onto the ground, followed by another. Upon closer inspection, someone has gone through a great deal of trouble to stuff rehydrated fish into every external nook and cranny of your ship. While more of an inconvenience than anything, you estimate that it's going to cost at least 5,000 credits to clean and deodorize.`

	`	For the first time since you've known him, Otto looks to be at a complete loss for words. After a long pause, he begins mumbling, pauses, then speaks.`
	`	"Ye... Aren't pullin' me leg, eh?" Otto paces back and forth, then addresses you in a low tone. "Flyin' into a wormhole. Yer braver than I gave ye credit for. And what's this at the end, here? 'Du Sook Ow'?" Otto points to the image of the ship you saw on the other side of the wormhole.`

	choice
		`	"No."`
		`	"I didn't think that was wise at the time."`
	`	"No doubt, yer a smart one. There's no tellin' how many pieces ye'd be in if ye'd done something as foolish as land on an alien planet without knowing whether they were friendly or not." Otto sighs again. "I'll have yer payment, and throw in more than enough to make up fer yer trouble. I can't tell ye what to do with this, but remember - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing." Otto opens the door, and you squeeze past his massive frame. Looking back, you're not exactly sure how he fit in there. He walks you back to the landing area.`

"This is no place to discuss such things, but ye've done great work here, kid. I can't thank ye enough. I'll have payment fer ye by the end of the day."`
	`	He opens the shed door. Light streams in, but his head is in shadow. As you push past him to leave, he firmly grabs your shoulder. "I can't keep ye from spreading this, but I think ye'd be safer keepin' it between us." He walks back to the landing area with you and shakes your hand.`

	`	You find Otto inspecting a ship as a scrawny-looking fellow hesitantly follows him. Judging by his appearance and body language, you take it Otto is inspecting his ship for some reason, though the whole affair seems more casual than professional. As you approach, Otto waves the captain off.`
	`	"Ye made it back! Tell me, what did ye find?"`

		`	"We're not alone out here."`
		`	"Three things: The wormhole in Ultima Thule connects to a secret sector of space, there are aliens there, and the aliens are giant squirrels."`

	`	Otto's cheerful expression goes blank. "Tell me what that means, exactly." You get the feeling that this is not the time for jokes.`

		`	"The wormhole leads to a sector of space a small number of humans have found, and they coexist alongside... Giant squirrels, who call themselves the 'Hai'."`

		`	"Hai are."`
	`	"'Hi are' who?"`
	
	choice
		`	"Hai are giant squirrel aliens who live peacefully alongside humans in a secret sector of space on the other side of the wormhole in Ultima Thule... Get it?"`
	`	Otto bludgeons you across the face with his club-like hand. "This is not the time fer jokes!"`
	
	label squirrels
	`	Before you can react, Otto half-pushes, half-drags you to a nearby utility shed. He shoves you in, looks around, then ducks inside, shutting the rusty door behind him.`
	`	"Sorry about that, kid, but yer gonna have to explain yerself."`
	choice
		`	"That's perfectly understandable. It's a strange situation. Basically, there's a stable wormhole and it leads to aliens. Aliens who resemble giant squirrels and call themselves the 'Hai'. They actually live quite peacefully with humans. Look, I landed on one of their worlds." [Show him your sensor logs]`
		`	"No need to be so rough! Here, take a look. This is a picture of a ship the Hai call the 'Aphid'. This is a picture of their closest planet, where many humans live. And..." Your face turns red as the screen displays a selfie you took of you and one of the Hai dockworkers on Allhome.`
	`	Though you can't really see him, you can hear Otto slap his face with his palm. He whispers angrily`
	`	"Don't tell me ye flew through a wormhole, saw an ALIEN ship, and then decided to tour the place?!?"`
	
	choice
		`	"Actually... That's exactly what happened."`
		`	"It wasn't so bad. There were human ships in orbit, so I figured it was safe."`
	`	"By the gods. I wish I had a dozen men half as reckless as ye! Most of 'em turn yellow at the sight of a Navy patrol." Otto sighs deeply, and you can hear the shed creak as he relaxes against it. "This is no place to discuss such things, but ye've done great work here, kid. I can't thank ye enough. I'll have payment fer ye by the end of the day."`
	`	He opens the shed door. Light streams in, but his head is in shadow. As you push past him to leave, he firmly grabs your shoulder and whispers to you. "I can't keep ye from spreadin' this, but I think ye'd be safer keeping it between us." He walks back to the landing area with you and shakes your hand.`
	`	"I'll be in and around Freedom in Almaaz, so stop by if ye'd like to continue this merry little adventure of ours. Fer now, keep safe! There's no telling what's out there." You leave, but can't help wondering about the odd nature of his last comment.`
	`	When you next check your account, you see that Otto has transferred 100,000 credits to you.`

You wonder what they're talking about, but by the time you get close enough to hear them over the din of the spaceport, the freighter captain begins walking away.`

	`	"United stand! Divided fall! Wolves of space we're roamin'! From port to port, from land to land, raiding ships so grand!"`
	`	The crowd breaks into hoots and cheers as they drift back to their work; Otto claps several on the back, smiling and laughing with them.

	`	You follow Otto away from the dusty spaceport to what can only be described as a 'tavern'. The dusty sign above reads 'Freedom's Fortune' Various characters - from shady, to extremely shady - crowd the tables, booths, and floorspace. It's not as clean as the well-regulated drinking establishments you've seen in Republic space, and the whole place has a distinctly raucous atmosphere, as men and women take advantage of the flexible hours offered by anarchy to dance and enjoy other entertainment. It certainly doesn't scream 'privacy' to you, though you've heard many other words screamed in the short time you've been here.`
	`	You pass by a table with several empty glasses and two stylish but comfortably-dressed men arguing loudly. You notice Otto swipe two fresh neon-lime-colored drinks from their table. For such a big guy, he seems to have surprisingly nimble hands. He leads you up a set of stairs and nods at a very rough-looking woman in her 20's with many scars standing guard outside a curtained door. Her steely gaze seems to pierce your soul for one fleeting moment as she opens the door to let you in.`
	`	Otto leads you into the small, elaborately furnished yet rustic room; when the door closes, everything outside goes eerily silent. You make your way to the circular booth and table occupying much of the room. The upholstery is made of a shiny, soft fabric you've never seen before. Otto gestures for you to sit, setting drinks down on each side of the table.`

A dozen things happen at once; your lips seem to freeze, then burn; your teeth start buzzing; your tongue starts to dance; and the air seems to rush out of your lungs. You can't help but spit it out immediately, followed by rapid sputtering and coughing. You down most of a glass of water in response.`

		`	"Are you trying to kill me?!?"`
	`	"Don't worry, laddy, they get rid of the dangerous bits before it goes in the drink! Most of 'em, at least. Ye can only do so much with a sieve." Otto chuckles, and you sincerely hope this is just his dry wit. "Now, let's get down to more important matters."`

	`	Otto laughs. "Hah! Well, it seems I sent ye to the right aliens." Otto takes a sip of water. "What do ye say to another little trip to Hai space? Find their biggest outfitter, get the specs of everythin' available, and bring the data back here. There'll be money in it fer ye, of course, but I'm thinkin' there'll be bigger fish down the road..."`

		`	"Consider it done."`

		`	"What's the point? You can't just purchase thousands of ship outfits without the Hai noticing."`

	`	You awkwardly stand and head toward the door. As you walk out, you look back at Otto. His hands are folded together; he does not look at you. The woman outside the door gives you a cutting gaze as you walk past, but you make it out the door and back to the spaceport without event."`

	`	As you approach the tavern, two men burst out of it and tumble into the dust, fists flying. Otto cheers as he leads you past them. "Get 'em, Kharim! Ho ho! 'Atta boy!"`

	`	"Way I see it, if a man threw a few punches in his youth, he resents a few people when he gets old. If a man threw no punches in his youth, he resents everyone." It sounds wise, but you wonder if that's only because it's vague and hard to prove.`

	`	Otto leads you into the tavern. He takes you straight to the stairs without getting drinks. The scarred woman you saw last time stands up from a table in the corner and walks past you, up the stairs. You and Otto follow. She stares at you coldly as she opens the door; you follow Otto in.`
	`	Two glasses of cold water occupy the lavish table. You sit down, but Otto unexpectedly occupies the position next to you. You scoot deeper into the curved booth. "Alright, lad! Let's see what ye've got here." You pull out your datapad and set it up on table. Otto's eyes light up.`
	`	"Pulse Cannon... Pulse Turret... Ion Cannon! That sounds promising, eh?" You nod. Otto retrieves a pad of his own and sets about comparing Human and Hai outfits. You try to follow him, but he flips past data faster than you can process it.`

		`	"Not at all."`
		`	"Anything for you, gramps."`
	`	Otto smiles and claps you on the shoulder. "Thanks fer gettin' this, kid. Ye won't regret it! Come back to Freedom when yer ready for somethin' with a little more bite, and we can really get crackin'! In the meantime, if ye find yourself headin' to Hai space, pick up some outfits fer me crew, eh? I'd like to see 'em get some use out o' this stuff."`
	`	You retrieve your datapad and follow Otto out of the room. Otto waves to you as you head down the stairs; you catch part of an exchange between Otto and the woman at the door. "Aye, that young'n is gonna bring ye somethin' special fer yer ship..."`
	`	On your way out of the building, you notice small stains of blood in the dirt outside. An ancient, scrawny-looking man with long grey hair scuffles out of the tavern behind you and begins sweeping it away. "Every Tuesday..." he mumbles.`
	`	Back on your ship, you find that Otto has contributed another <payment> to your account. Whether a small scrap of meat to keep you interested, or simply the end of Otto's no-doubt limited reserves, is impossible to say.`

	`	As you approach the ship, Otto emerges. He leads two pirates who bear a stretcher between them; a bloody cloth covers the still form on the stretcher. He pauses upon seeing you, then waves you over.`

Most of the group disperses, but the female pirate in the group hangs back and exchanges a few words with Otto. He gives her a small badge, hugs her, and then offers a short salute.`

	label what
	`	You follow beside Otto as he leads the pair of pirates away from the spaceport. You see subdued anger in the eyes of the man; the woman appears apathetic. Several other pirates emerge from the ship, following you.`
	`	"This bastard here raped a passenger aboard a merchant vessel." Otto spits into the dirt. "Young one, too." He continues on, solemnly measuring every step. It appears the procession is heading toward one of the mesa's valleys.`
	choice
		`	"I don't mean to pry, but how did he go from that, to this?"`
			goto how
		`	"Looks like he got what he deserved."`
	`	"Damn right." Otto mutters something you can't quite hear, then continues. "I ain't a saint myself, and I don't expect the lads to be. If they were, they'd be off playing nurse with the Humanitarian Corps or somethin'." Though you don't ask, he continues on.`
	
	label how
	`	"He came back to port, boastin' about his great victory - typical braggin', it's what ye do. All the captains take turns. When he was about to leave, Denver here..." - he points to the man at the head of the stretcher - "...told me about certain 'excesses' the good captain took while the crew was seizing the cargo." You look back at the man. He avoids your glance. For the first time, you notice a little blood on Otto's left hand.`
	choice
		`	"That still doesn't explain how he ended up like this."`
		`	"So... You killed him?"`
	`	Otto halts, bringing the procession to a standstill. He glances back at the lingering crowd, then continues walking. It appears he doesn't mind sharing this in front of his cohort. "Denver told me in confidence. But it's one o' our rules." Otto clears his throat; his tone shifts distinctly toward anger.`
	`	"So I went back to his ship and asked. He said he didn't do nothin'. I asked who'd swear fer him, and no one did. But Ilena confirmed it. And even then, he said he only 'does it when they give him trouble.'" Otto curses. "It ain't the action, kid; it's the denial. Ye can save a man with remorse in his heart. There's nothin' to be done when his heart is twisted too."`
	`	The group arrives at the edge of the valley cliff. Otto makes a motion to the two stretcher-bearers, who turn the body toward Otto. He unceremoniously throws the cheap cloth over the cliff's edge, revealing the wounds inflicted upon the dead man; you wretch when you see that a metal sheet has been nailed into his chest, roughly over his heart, labeled simply, "RAPE". A cheap knife has been driven through a slit in the plate up to the handguard.`
	`	Otto solemnly addresses the silent group. Judging by their expressions, you get the impression they witnessed much worse than the aftermath. "Everyone knows the crime. This ain't vengeance; this is justice, pure and simple." Otto gives a signal, and the two stretcher-bearers cast the body into the rocky valley below.`
	choice
		`	[Peek over the edge.]`
	`	Roughly a hundred feet below, a long-dry riverbed runs through the valley, now partially overrun by rocks originating from the near slope. You see about half a dozen bodies below, each roughly adorned with a metal plate. You can't make out any words from here.`
	`	As everyone begins meandering back to the town, Otto puts his hand on your shoulder briefly, though you don't grasp the significance. Perhaps he requests understanding, or is trying to comfort you from what you witnessed. When you make it back to the spaceport, most of the group disperses, but the female pirate in the group hangs back and exchanges a few words with Otto. He gives her a small badge, hugs her, and then offers a short salute.`
	
	label stay
	`	"C'mon, kid. Let's turn our attention to more pleasant matters, eh?" You accompany Otto to the now-familiar tavern. The noise inside has lowered to a dull roar since your last visit; you wonder if it has something to do with the events of the day. You follow Otto upstairs to your usual meeting room, noting the presence of the scarred woman once more.`

		`	"What do you have in mind?"`
	`	"We need a way to engineer this tech ourselves. And as ye might imagine, we couldn't engineer a wooden box." You chuckle a bit, knowing that Otto is exaggerating, but understanding the reputation pirates have as idiots and fools. "Most of our tech is stolen or outdated castoffs from the Syndicate."`

			goto stolen
		`	"The Syndicate?"`

The Syndicate don't talk about us, they don't invite us to birthday parties, but when we have something they need they'll be the first to remember us. The Syndicate is a business, and it's the way of business to go smoother without competition."`

		`	"The Syndicate is legendarily wealthy. What do you have that they could possibly want?"`

			goto fighting

			goto business
	`	"Wealthy, aye, but they have their problems. Customers who back out o' deals. Clients who know too much. Merchants who turn down their protection service. Republic officials who distrust the Syndicate and dig a little too deep... Problems ye can't solve with a string of suspicious deaths. No one likes an unsolved murder."`
	choice
		`	"I knew the Syndicate was bad news."`
			goto badnews
		`	"You're lying! The Syndicate would never hire Pirates to assassinate a member of the Republic."`
	`	Otto chuckles, but doesn't appear perturbed by your accusation in the slightest. "Believe what ye want, kid. But the next time ye hear about a Republic diplomatic convoy attacked by pirates, take note, they're rarely taken hostage. And the only thing more worthless than a politician is a dead polititian." Otto sighs. "Now, about yer part in all this."`
		goto business

	`	Otto chuckles knowingly. "Yer right, they do. But yer probably thinkin' about Pirates as one big group of people who kinda decide what to do. But fer every well-organized bunch ready to play their cards, there are a hundred star-kissers blowin' themselves to kingdom come tryin' to score big and make their own way." Otto clears his throat. "Make a deal one day, make another deal the next. That's how some do it. But about yer part in this."`
		goto business
	
	label stolen
	`	"It may come as a great surprise to ye that we're all pitifully poor out here. In the grand scheme o' things, I mean. Sure, we've got our moments, and even a few wealthy speculators who like the sound of planets without law. But even when we do get a lucky break, ye can only divide a piece o' bread among so many rats before all you're left with is crumbs." Otto clears his throat. "But about yer part in all this."`
	
	label business
	`	"We've got three big problems keepin' us from exploitin' this tech. One, we don't have the raw materials. Two, we don't have the manufacturin' facilities. And three, we have absolutely no bleedin' idea how to make anythin' close to the damn things. And I know I look smart, but even ol' Otto can't make a blaster out o' sand!" Otto laughs.`
	`	"So we're going to solve that last problem first. There's a certain less-than-respectable member of the Syndicate who's been utilizing the services of a convicted scientist."`
	choice
		`	"A convicted scientist?"`
		`	"Alright. Where do I go?"`
			goto meetup2
	`	Otto nods. "She used to be one of the Republic's leadin' researchers on Quarg tech. Talk is, she came close to figurin' out what made their weapons work."`

		`	"What did she do?"`
			goto scientist
	`	"Tall, funny-lookin' guys down south. Don't ask me, never met one."`
	choice
		`	"So what did she do?"`
	label scientist
	`	Otto laughs. "Well, legend is, she eventually figured out how to make a powerful beam laser. Twice as strong as a Heavy Laser, and half the weight. But... Well, she wasn't the most careful, let's just say. Covered up a few anomolies in the test results and rushed it off for testing. Long tale short, the Republic ship it was installed on blew up, and all hands were lost."`
	choice
		`	"Sounds like an honest mistake."`
		`	"Why did she cover up her mistakes?"`
	`	"Well... It's not exactly a gray area, lad. I don't know her personally, but talk is, she's got a few screws loose, and don't take questioning well. During the investigation, they found dozens of faked results, missin' prototypes, and a handful o'... Morally questionable studies. The Syndicate saw an opportunity and swiped her before trial. Faked her death in a lab accident and all that."`
	choice
		`	"How do you know all this? And why do you want a scientist who faked lab results?"`
	`	Otto chuckles. "I may be partially responsible fer a few missing prototypes. One of my nephews worked with her back in the day. Crazy then. Probably moreso now." Otto scratches his forehead. "But smarter than half the Syndicate eggheads all put together."`
	
	label meetup2
	`	"She's been shipped between Syndicate prison labs fer the past five years or so. But she's bein' moved to Quicksilver sometime soon, which means an opportunity fer us!

		`	"Won't the Syndicate be upset?"`
	`	Otto laughs. "Kid, I'd count on it! They'll be breathing down your neck all the way back to unclaimed space. But if you managed to plunder a handful of incriminatin' documents, and it were exposed to the Republic..."`

Ye've never met Brand, but he'll have your back." Otto opens the door to let you out. He addresses the woman outside. "Dutch, get Brand. Our young friend is ready to fly!" Otto laughs and pats you on the back. "They'll meet you at the spaceport, kid. Buckle up. And don't be an idiot. My people are responsible for themselves, but I don't want any deaths out there."`
	`	As you turn to leave, Dutch jogs up the stairs with a younger man you presume to be Brand. Tattoes and several unconventional piercings adorn his face; he gives you a friendly grin through what appears to be a translucent lip guage filled with glycerin water and sparkles, exposing a glittery view of his teeth.

Brand has a remarkable number of tattoos and unusual facial piercings. Dutch crosses her arms and, with a noticeable Irish accent, says "We're ready when ye are." Brand smiles and playfully remarks, "Guess we're flyin' with you, huh? Don't get us fried, yeah?" Glitter, suspended in some glycerin, creates a snowglobe effect in his translucent lip guage. You try to ignore it.`

	`	Your crew springs to action. Your tech grabs a plasma torch from his belt and begins cutting through the chains. The woman addresses the tech; "Hm... 6.4. Keep your eyes on the prize there, deadeye. Let's not get wild with the plasma now."`
	`	It takes a few tense moments, but luckily, nothing catastrophic happens. It appears the rest of the crew is incapacitated or hiding in the fore of the ship. Your crew carefully tip the cage over, exposing a locked trapdoor in the bottom of the cage. You breathe a sigh of relief, as this lock has a manual release. The woman crawls out of the cell, and you rush to the airlock door, squeezing through one at a time. You notice your former prisoner has lagged behind you, but follows quickly enough. Back on your ship, the woman takes a seat in the cockpit as you disengage from the Vanguard.`

Your crew wrenches the Vanguard's airlock door the rest of the way; it gives in with a shriek and a crunch. You're able to wrestle the cage onto a hovercart and rush it into your ship; the crew rush back to their duties. You notice your 'rescuee' still smiling menacingly as you head to the cockpit.`

Upon noting Otto's presence, she not-so-gracefully rolls off the chair and approaches you.`
