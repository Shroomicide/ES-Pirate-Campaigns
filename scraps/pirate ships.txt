	description "During the Alpha Wars, no Republic ships had the speed or durability to extract key resources and VIPs from besieged planets. Inspired by ancient Earth science-fiction, an independent manufacturer designed a sleek blockade runner for just that purpose, and it went on to rescue vital assets throughout the war. The Centennial Eagle was derived from the original design and manufactured on the 400th anniversary of the war, but the Navy halted production shortly afterward, concerned that its vast engine space and deceptively large cargo capacity would make it a tool for smugglers."
